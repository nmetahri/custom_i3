# i3-Gnome Environment Setup + My Tmux Config

This repository contains a complete, opinionated setup for an i3-Gnome environment on Debian/Ubuntu-based systems.

It is installed via a single script that handles all package dependencies (like `gdm3`, `gnome-session`, `gnome-keyring`, etc.), builds `i3blocks`, and copies all personal configuration files.

## How to use ?

Each directory is independant so you can install whatever you want.

It is recommended to install and configure packages in that order : 
- I3
- Tmux

## External Dependencies

This setup builds and installs from the following external projects:

- **i3blocks** (https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks) — Status bar for i3
- **i3-gnome** (https://github.com/i3-gnome/i3-gnome.git) — Gnome 3 session integration with i3

Both are automatically cloned, built, and installed by the install script. Check their repositories for license information and updates.

## How to install a package ?

### Tmux

All you have to do, in order to install and configure tmux, is :
- Go to package directory (e.g. `cd tmux`)
- Give execution permission to `install`
- Execute `install` as **super user (sudo)**

### I3

All you have to do, in order to install and configure i3-gnome environment, is :
- Go to i3 directory (e.g. `cd i3`)
- Give execution permission to `install.sh`
- Execute `install.sh` as **super user (sudo)**
- Reboot your system and select `i3+gnome` session at login screen
- Login and enjoy your new i3-gnome environment !

## Some commands to know for my i3-gnome environment

## Theme System

This setup includes a dynamic theme switching system that allows you to easily change color schemes.

### Available Themes
1. **Minimaliste** - Clean and minimal color palette
2. **Glassmorphism** - Modern frosted glass aesthetic
3. **Cyberpunk** - Neon-inspired dark theme
4. **Material** - Google Material Design colors
5. **Solarized** - The popular Solarized dark theme
6. **Gruvbox** - Warm, retro-inspired colors

### How to Switch Themes
Press `$mod+Shift+t` to open the theme selector (dmenu). Choose a theme from the list and it will be immediately applied to:
- i3bar colors and styling
- Window decorations
- All i3 UI elements
- Alacritty terminal colors (automatically synced)

The active theme is managed via a symlink (`colors-active.conf`) that points to the selected theme file. This symlink is automatically created on first installation.

### Adding Custom Themes
To add a custom theme:
1. Create a new `.conf` file in `~/.config/i3/themes/` following this naming pattern: `N-themename.conf` (where N is a number)
2. Define your colors using the following variables:
   ```
   set $bg #1e1e2e
   set $fg #cdd6f4
   set $border-active #89b4fa
   set $border-inactive #45475a
   set $text-urgent #f38ba8
   ```
3. Run `$mod+Shift+t` and select your new theme

## Alacritty Configuration

Alacritty is automatically configured and managed by the installation script.

### Configuration
- Base configuration is located in `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml`
- The configuration is synced during installation and updates
- Alacritty colors are coordinated with your i3 theme system

### Updating Alacritty Config
When you pull updates from the repository and want to update Alacritty configuration:
```bash
cd i3
sudo ./install --update
```

This will update both i3 and Alacritty configurations to the latest versions.

## How to assign an application to a specific workspace ?

In order to assign an application to a specific workspace, you will need to get it's WM class name, to do so, you can save this alias in your bashrc : 

`alias get-window-class="xprop | grep WM_CLASS | awk '{ print \$4 }'"`

When you execute this command, you will have to select a window and it will display its class name, then you can add something like this in your `~/.config/i3/custom.conf` : 

```
assign [class="Firefox"] $ws3
for_window [class="Firefox"] focus
```  

This will always assign Firefox to workspace 3 and focus it when it is launched.
